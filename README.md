Ideas
=====

- Single-page app statically hosted on GitHub Pages
- Custom 404 page to handle routing (Gah! This probably isn't going to work: https://help.github.com/articles/custom-404-pages)
- JavaScript uses [GitHub API with JSONP](http://developer.github.com/v3/#json-p-callbacks) to load any Markdown file
- Use an external service like Disqus to allow comments

Let's see if this works!
